Smart Light Alarm – IoT Project (UNO R4 WiFi + PushingBox API)

This project is an upgraded version of our Assignment 1 alarm system.
For Assignment 2, the goal was to add WiFi and an online API so the alarm could work as an IoT device instead of only a basic circuit.

The idea is still the same: when the light sensor detects strong light, the buzzer turns on.
The difference now is that the system also sends a message to the PushingBox API through WiFi.
A button was added so the user can snooze the alarm for 15 seconds.
